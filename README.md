# nvim.gdb

This is a very lightweight, configuration-free, command-free GDB plugin that will automatically display GDB's stack frames and breakpoints in the signcolumn of their corresponding neovim buffers when running GDB from neovim's terminal.

In order to use it, source nvim.py from your .gdbinit.
